Evading security software has always been a subject of interest. My earliest memories of handling a computer involve gaining access to my siblings' Windows 98 accounts and password-protecting arbitrary Word documents with unguessable passphrases. Later in life, I developed a fascination for wireless packet injection, the art of social engineering, and breaking websites with malformed input. Today, I've published over 100 technical write-ups, hold offensive security certifications, and share what I've learned over the years with whoever will listen.
